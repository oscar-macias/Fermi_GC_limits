This distribution contains machine-readable text files corresponding
to the analysis and results of ApJ, XXX, XXX. These files can be
divided into the following categories:

===============================
=== Dark Matter Constraints ===
===============================
Number of files: 6
File naming: limits_<channel>.txt
Description:
    Upper limits on the DM annihilation cross section versus mass for
    individual targets and the combined analysis of 41 dwarf galaxies
    and dwarf galaxy candidates.  Note that individual target limits
    are profiled with respect to the J-Factor uncertainty of the
    respective dwarf galaxy in the same way as done in the combined
    analysis.
    
Structure:
    Column [0]:    Dark matter particle mass (GeV)
    Column [1-25]: Constraints on <sigmav> derived
        from each target with either a kinematically
        determined J-factor or a predicted J-factor (for ).        
    Column [26]: Constraints on <sigmav> derived from a combined
        analysis of the 41 targets in the "standard" sample.

================================
===  Bin-By-Bin Flux Limits  ===
================================
Number of files: 1
File naming: bin_by_bin_limits_<type>.txt
Description:
    Bin-by-bin upper limits for each dwarf galaxy on the integral
    (type=eflux) and differential (type=e2dnde) flux.  Both
    calculations model the flux distribution within an energy bin as a
    power-law with index=2.

Structure:
    Column [0-1]: Minimum and maximum energy edges of each bin
        (MeV).        
    Column [2-27]: Energy flux upper limit (MeV cm^-2 s^-1;
        type=eflux) or E^2 times the differential flux upper limit
        (MeV cm^-2 s^-1; type=e2dnde) derived from each dwarf galaxy
        in the energy bin specified by Columns [0-1].

================================
===  Bin-By-Bin Likelihoods  ===
================================
Number of files: 45
File naming: like_<dwarf>.txt
Description:
    These files contain likelihood functions for each target derived 
    energy-bin by energy-bin, tabulated as the delta log-like value 
    for 25 different values of the energy flux of a putative dwarf source.
Structure:
    Column [0-1]: Minimum and maximum energy edges of each
        bin (MeV).        
    Column [2]: Energy flux (MeV cm^-2 s^-1) of a putative dwarf
        source integrated over the specified bin.        
    Column [3]:   Delta log-likelihood as a function of
        the energy flux of the source

================================
===  Likelihood SEDs         ===
================================
Number of files: 1
File naming: like_all_targets.fits
Description:
    FITS file with bin-by-bin results (likelihood, flux, TS, upper
    limits) for all targets.  The file contains a single BINTABLE with    
    one row per target.  The information in this table is the same as
    provided in the bin-by-bin flux and likelihood ascii tables.

Columns:
    name: Target name.
    e_min: Lower bin edge in MeV.
    e_ref: Bin center in MeV.
    e_max: Upper bin edge in MeV.
    dloglike_scan : Delta log-likelihood vs. source amplitude
        in each energy bin.
    norm_scan : Scan points for likelihood profile in units of the
        reference model amplitude.  Multiply by ref_eflux to convert
        this column to energy flux.
    loglike : Model likelihood at the best-fit source amplitude.
    ref_eflux : Reference model amplitude in energy
        flux ( MeV / (cm2 * s) ).
    ref_flux : Reference model amplitude in flux ( 1 / (cm2 * s) ).
    ref_npred : Reference model amplitude in counts.
    ref_dnde : Reference model amplitude in differential
        flux ( 1 / (MeV * cm2 * s) ).

=========================
===  Example Scripts  ===
=========================
Also included in this directory are a set of example scripts to 
aid with a few potential usage cases. These scripts are merely 
meant to illustrate how to operate with the data included here 
and *DO NOT* represent a rigorous analysis, nor do they constitute 
a fully fledged interface to the data themselves. A brief 
description of the examples is included below.

example1.py -- This example demonstrates how to load 
               and plot the dark matter limit files.
example2.py -- This example demonstrates how to load
               and plot the bin-by-bin likelihood limits.
example3.py -- This example demonstrates how to load
               the bin-by-bin likelihood functions and a 
               gamma-ray spectrum and compute spectrally-
               dependent dark matter limits on the 
               annihilation cross section.
               NOTE: This script *DOES NOT* incorporate 
               uncertainties on the measured J-factor.
